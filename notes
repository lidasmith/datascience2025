preference of coat?

Q: what coat do you want on your dog?
(corded, curly, double, hairless, rough, silky, smooth, wavy, wiry)
- capitalize all words

Q: what length do you want the coat to be at?
(Long, Medium, Short)

coat user wants = 5*how much they want it

1/14 = 7.14% 
1/16 = 6.25% (no rounding!)

on a scale of 1 - 5, how affectionate with family do you want your dog to be?
1 = 20% of 6.25%, 2 = 40% of 6.25% and so on.
 
row 1 x 6.52 x 1-5 var = 
max is 6.52
6.52 - (row x var)?
no.
DO IT AS A WHOLE ROW!! ditch 6.52.
row1 x var1 + row2 x var2 etc... = dog breed score
vars are the input from user
create dog breed score into var and find the highest.
easy peasy

- PROBLEM: may not add up to 100. not sure if this affects score.

what coat would you prefer questions are followed by a percentage of the preference question.

Intro: be sure to state that they can't/should try not to choose all 5's for most accurate results.
